## Introduction
The Systematic Assessment of Vessel Emissions (SAVE) model, is a Python-based model developed by ICCT marine team that combines ships’ Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and ships’ characteristics data to understand historical operational behavior, voyage pattern, routing network, and estimate energy consumption, and tank-to-wake (TTW) emissions from the global shipping industry. SAVE was first developed in 2017 with the release of a flagship report [Greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping, 2013–2015 (Olmer et al., 2017)](https://theicct.org/publication/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-global-shipping-2013-2015/). 

In 2020 SAVE went through a series of major updates with the release of [IMO’s 4th Greenhouse Gas Study](https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/Environment/Pages/Fourth-IMO-Greenhouse-Gas-Study-2020.aspx) which ICCT shared authorship with a consortium led by CE-Delft. In early 2025, we published the updated global ship emissions inventory, 2016-2023, in which SAVE was further updated (SAVE v2025.1) to reflect updated understandings of ship engine performance and policy development. 

## Scope
The SAVE Model is designed to assess ship activities and emissions at a global scale on a yearly basis. The two primary data sources for ship activities are as follows:
* Ship characteristics database: The data vendor is S&P Global (previously IHS Markit). The database includes detailed characteristics of ships registered with the IMO. IMO mandates propelled, seagoing merchant ships of 100 gross tonnage and above to register with a unique 7-digit identifier (IMO number) and report ship characteristics. Normally a ship engaged in domestic navigation only would not appear in this dataset. We also use the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) database to augment ship identification which are otherwise not present in the S&P Global database.
* AIS data: The AIS data vendor is Spire (previously exactEarth). AIS data captures AIS signals transmitted by all objects that install AIS devices, which include ship and non-ship objects. IMO only mandates the installation of AIS devices on ships of 300 gross tonnage and upwards engaged in international voyages, although many more ships do so voluntarily. We include as many ships as possible in the SAVE model, but we do not evaluate non-ships.

When matching these two data together, we have matches and mismatches. Below is a table of which ships are in scope after the matching.

**Table 1.** In scope data categories

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|Type1|AIS data matched to a vessel in the S&P Global database with IMO number|
|Type2|AIS data matched to a vessel in the S&P Global database with MMSI number instead of IMO number|
|Type3|AIS data matched to Global Fishing Watch ship characteristics database with a gross tonnage ≥100 instead of the S&P Global database|
|Type4|In service fleet in the ship characteristics database with a gross tonnage between 100-300 yet not present in the AIS data|

## Methodology: Type1&2
The methodology was first developed in [Greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping, 2013–2015](https://theicct.org/publication/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-global-shipping-2013-2015/). In this model documentation, we include the key model elements which are likely needed to be updated over time. If any specific method-related issues are not addressed in this document, please refer to the original [detailed methodology description](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Global-shipping-GHG-emissions-2013-2015_Methodology_17102017_vF.pdf). Below we describe methodology used for Type1&2 vessels.

### Emissions estimation: core function
At the core of the SAVE Model, is a bottom-up emissions inventory model, which estimates spatial-temporal energy consumption of each individual ship at a very fine resolution. Emissions are influenced by a ship’s operating phase, power demand, emission factors for each pollutant, draught, and a number of external factors including hull fouling and weather. Emissions from ships come from main engines (ME), auxiliary engines (AE), and boilers (BO). In the following equations, ME power demand is a function of installed ME power and ME load factor; AE and BO power demand depends on the ship class and capacity bin and the phase in which the ship is operating: cruise,maneuver, anchor, or berth (Table 2). Depending on how emission factors are measured, emissions are calculated using either Equation 1 or 2.

***Equation 1***

$$E_{i,j}=\displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\left(P_{ME_{i}}*LF_{i,t}*EF_{ME_{j,k,l,m}}+D_{AE_{p,i,t}}*EF_{AE_{j,k,l,m}}+D_{BO_{p,i,t}}*EF_{BO_{j,m}}\right)*1hour\right)$$

***Equation 2***

$$E_{i,j}=\displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\left(FC_{ME_{i,t}}*EF_{ME_{j,m}}+FC_{AE_{i,t}}*EF_{AE_{j,m}}+FC_{BO_{i,t}}*EF_{BO_{j,m}}\right)*1hour\right)$$

where:

| $EF_{BO_{j,m}}$ | = boiler emission factor (g/kWh) for pollutant j and fuel type m, See Section 5|
| $FC_{ME_{i,t}}$ | = main engine fuel consumption rate (g/g of fuel) for ship i at time t, defined by Equation 8|
| $EF_{ME_{j,m}}$ | = main engine emission factor (g/g of fuel) for pollutant j, and fuel type m, See Section 5|
| $FC_{AE_{i,t}}$ | = auxiliary engine fuel consumption rate(g/g of fuel) for ship i at time t, defined by Equation 8|
| $EF_{AE_{j,m}}$ | = auxiliary engine emission factor (g/g of fuel) for pollutant j, and fuel type m, See Section 5|
| $FC_{BO_{i,t}}$ | = boiler power fuel consumption rate (g/g of fuel) for ship i at time t, defined by Equation 8|
| $EF_{BO_{j,m}}$ | = boiler emission factor (g/g of fuel) for pollutant j and fuel type m, See Section 5|

In the next sections, we further explain the inputs, assumptions and methods that fed into the above two core functions.

#### 1. Ship characteristics database
S&P Global data was delivered to us on an annual basis. So far, we have the 2017-2023 versions. The raw data is processed to 1)fill in null values; and 2)derive key inputs for emissions estimation. For each inventory year, we use the year-specific S&P Global data to match with AIS data of the same year. Across different years, the same ships always are assigned with the same unique ID numbers based on their IMO numbers (_ship_id_). However, across different years, the same ships are not always assigned with the same MMSI number (changed after re-sale to a different flag state). As a result, it's necessary that we have year-specific ship characteristics database. Processing of the S&P Global data involves the following procedures:

##### <ins>1.1 Ship class and capacity bin</ins>
Aligned with the [4th IMO GHG Study](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Environment/Documents/Fourth%20IMO%20GHG%20Study%202020%20-%20Full%20report%20and%20annexes.pdf), we classify each vessel as one of 19 unique ship classes via the StatCode5 field. Each ship is also assigned a capacity bin according to its cargo or passenger capacity. The combined ship class andcapacity bin categorizations resulted in a total of 70 unique ship groups. The main purpose of reclassifying each ship from its ship type to its ship class is to estimate each ship’s auxiliary engine (AE) and boiler (BO) power demand under different operating modes (cruising, maneuvering, at berth, and at anchor), presented in Table 2 and Table 3.

Ship type and capacity bin are also used to categorize whether a ship belongs to International, Domestic or Fishing categories (Table 4). This is consistent with the 4th IMO GHG Study although the study also considers a voyage-based determination of that categorization. For the later, most ships would have both international and domestic activities. 

 **Table 4.** How ships are assigned to international, domestic, and fishing categories

|Category|Ship classes|Gross tonnage|
|---|---|---|
|International|Passenger ferries, roll on-passenger ferries|>=2000 gt|
|International|Bulk carrier, chemical tanker, container, cruise, general cargo, liquefied gas tanker, oil tanker, other liquid tankers, refrigerated bulk, Ro-Ro, vehicle|All|
|Domestic|Passenger ferries, roll on-passenger ferries|<2000 gt|
|Domestic|Miscellaneous—other, offshore, serviceother, service-tug, yacht|All|
|Fishing|Miscellaneous—fishing|All|

##### <ins>1.2 Engine NOx tier</ins>
Because newer marine engines are subject to more stringent NOx emission standards, a ship’s year of construction influences its NOx emissions. MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 13 defines
tiered NOx emission standards based on a vessel’s year of construction, as defined in Table 5.

**Table 5.** IMO NOx tiers

| Tier | Keel laid year |
|---|---|
|Tier 0 | Pre-2000 |
|Tier 1 | 2000–2010 |
|Tier 2 | 2010-2015 |
|Tier 3 | Depending on enactment years of different NOx ECAs|

>NOTE:
>Since the first NECA was enacted in 2016, by default we assigned ships keel laid after 2016 as Tier 3. The SAVE model would determine whether a ship is performing as Tier 3 compliant by evaluating its location, keel laid year, and the enactment year of the NECA the ship is operating in. We also assume that ships outside of ECA will switch to only Tier 2 compliant if they are keel laid after 2016.

##### <ins>1.3 Main fuel type, operational fuel type</ins>
The S&P Global ship characteristics database includes fields that indicate the types of fuel each ship uses. The fuel type for ships that operate on oil-based marine fuels is categorized as residual fuel or distillate fuel. There are two fuel type fields in the database: FuelType1First and FuelType2Second. FuelType1First records the lightest fuel on board (distillate is considered a lighter fuel than residual, for example); FuelType2Second records the heaviest fuel on board. A main fuel type (i.e., the type of fuel, either residual or distillate, on which the ship primarily operates) was assigned to each vessel based on the fuels specified in FuelType1First and FuelType2Second. If either fuel type is listed as residual fuel, residual fuel is recorded as its main fuel type. If the ship carries only distillate on board, the ship is assumed to operate on distillate fuel. If a ship’s FuelType1First or FuelType2Second is indicated to be LNG or gas boil off, the main fuel type is assumed to be LNG. If a ship’s FuelType1First or FuelType2Second is indicated to be methanol, the main fuel type is assumed to be MeOH. If a ship’s FuelType1First or FuelType2Second is recorded as Nuclear, the ship is assumed to operate on nuclear power. For ships with missing data in FuelType1First or FuelType2Second, ships with main engine (ME) speeds of less than 600 revolutions per minute (rpm) are assigned to residual fuel, while ships with a ME speed greater than 600 rpm are assigned to distillate. If the ME rpm is missing, the average ME rpm for that ship type and capacity bin is used for that ship. If there is no valid average ME rpm by ship type and capacity bin, then the average rpm by ship class and capacity bin is used instead. As of 2023 inventory year, no ships are designed to use fuels other than residual, distillate, LNG, methanol, nuclear, and coal.

For operational fuel type, we assume the following:
* All ships with residual fuel as main fuel type operate on residual fuel unless they:
  * Operate in ECAs, where they operate on distillate fuel instead, unless
    * They are installed with scrubbers, where they operate on residual fuel
  * Post 2020, all ships operate on very low sulfur fuel due to Global Sulfur Limit, unless
    * They are installed with scrubbers, where they operate on residual fuel
* All ships with all other fuel types as main fuel type operate on original fuel types.

##### <ins>1.4 Speed, power, and rpm</ins>
S&P Global data include fields for each ship’s maximum vessel speed, ME power, and ME rpm. Where missing, these data were backfilled by considering the characteristics of similar ships. For each ship class, average maximum vessel speed, ME power, and ME rpm were calculated within each ship capacity bin. Vessels with missing data were assigned the mean value for their ship class and capacity bin. Between 2017 and 2021, S&P Global data delivered to us has mistakenly listed the service speed field as the maximum speed field. When this mistake was fixed, we replaced all processed ship characteristics database to reflect the correct maximum speed record for each ship.

##### <ins>1.5 Engine type</ins>
Engine types are used to match the most relevant emission factors. Aligned with the [4th IMO GHG Study](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Environment/Documents/Fourth%20IMO%20GHG%20Study%202020%20-%20Full%20report%20and%20annexes.pdf), we classify each vessel into one of nine engine types: steam turbines (ST), gas turbines (GT), slow speed diesel (SSD), medium speed diesel (MSD), high speed diesel (HSD), lean burn spark-ignited LNG engines(LBSI), low-pressure dual fuel slow speed LNG engines (LPDF 2-stroke),low-pressure dual fuel medium speed LNG engines (LPDF 4-stroke), and high-pressure injection dual-fuel LNG engines (HPDF 2-stroke). We classified each ship into an engine type as follows:
*	Any ship with a “Reciprocating” or “Turbine” MainEngineType was classified as ST.
*	Any ship with a “Gas” MainEngineType was classified as GT.
*	Remaining ships with a main fuel type of LNG have engine types assigned based on the fields MainEngineModel, MainEngineDesigner, and MainEngineStroke:
 * ME model numbers containing "ME" but no "GA" were classified as HPDF 2-stroke;
 * ME designer containing "Bergens" were classified as LBSI;
 * MainEngineStroke as 4 were classified as LPDF 4-stroke;
 * ME model numbers containing ("X" and "DF") or ("ME" and "GA") were classified as LPDF 2-stroke;
 * All other LNG-fueled ships were classified as LPDF 4-stroke.
*	Remaining ships are assumed to be motor propelled ships. For ships with valid ME rpms, the following rules are applied:
 * < 300 rpm were classified as SSD
 * ≥ 300 rpm and < 900 RPM were classified as MSD
 * ≥ 900 rpm were classified as HSD
 * Remaining ships were assigned an ME rpm based on the average ME rpm for the ship’s type and capacity bin, if available, or based on the average ME rpm for the ship’s class and capacity bin. These ships then have an engine type assigned based on the procedures in the previous SSD/MSD/HSD assignments.

#### 2. AIS data
AIS data is delivered to us via AWS, so raw AIS data is stored in AWS S3. Although AIS data are collected every few seconds, to reduce the size of the dataset and increase computational speeds, exactEarth provided hourly-aggregated AIS data for all ships with registered AIS transponders. Information associated with each AIS point include the following:
* MMSI number: a unique identification number associated with each AIS transmitting device
* IMO number: a unique identification number associated with each registered vessel
* TIME: the timestamp associated with each AIS point, formatted as Year-Month-DateHour
* LAT: latitude associated with each AIS point, in decimal degrees
* LON: longitude associated with each AIS point, in decimal degrees
* SOG: speed-over-ground associated with each AIS point, in knots
* Draught: instantaneous draught associated with each AIS point, in decimeters

After matching AIS data with the ship characteristics database, we classified the results and only data classified as Table 1 were included in further analysis and stored in ICCT AWS RDS via PostgreSQL. This step is referred to as ***Normalization***. 

##### <ins>2.1 Removing invalid data</ins>
Next, we remove invalid latitude, longitude, and SOG instances in the matched dataset. We remove records with latitudes outside the normal range of -90 to 90 degrees, longitudes outside
the normal range of -180 to 180, and SOGs greater than 1.5 times the maximum speed of the ships. We then replace these missing fields with interpolated values. 

##### <ins>2.2 Interpolating missing AIS data points</ins>
We assume that a ship continuously transmit AIS signals in a given year. So any missing hours between the first seen signal and the last seen signal need to be interpolated. We linearly interpolated the ship’s position and speed over ground. For example, if a ship was traveling from point A at timestamp 1 to point C at timestamp 3, but the position and speed over ground were unknown for timestamp 2, the interpolated point B would situate at the center of segment AC. The interpolated SOG is equal to the great circle distance between points A and C divided by the time elapsed between timestamp 1 and timestamp 2. For ferries, tugs, and fishing vessels, the SOG was not linearly interpolated, but taken as a random sample of all valid SOGs for each individual ship. These ship classes were treated differently for several reasons. Ferries and tugs tend to operate within small geographic regions, so although they may appear to travel very little distance, resulting in an interpolated SOG of close to 0, they may actually have travelled at higher speeds. Similarly, fishing vessels often travel in a circular path as they fish. In this case, the start and end latitude and longitude may be very similar, implying close to 0 SOG, even though these ships did travel at speeds greater than 0. For these reasons, a simple linear interpolation to fill missing SOGs for these ship classes was not appropriate. Therefore, missing SOGs for these ship classes are taken as a random sample of all valid SOGs for each individual ship. 

##### <ins>2.3 Phase</ins>
While in service, a ship is operating in one of four phases: at berth, at anchor, maneuvering, or cruising. A ship’s operating phase is used to estimate AE and BO power demand (Table 2 and 3), crucial information for estimating emissions from those engines. A ship’s phase is determined by its proximity to land or port and its SOG. Table 6 and Table 7 present the way these two features define the ship’s phase. The tables are split between ships that are not liquid tankers and ships that are liquid tankers. Liquid tankers represent a special case because they often are lightered offshore; thus, they can be considered at berth when berthing within 5 nautical miles from port.

 **Table 6.** Phase assignment decision matrix for all ship classes except liquid tankers

| Speed over ground | <= 1 nm from port | <= 1 nm from coast | 1-5 nm from coast | >= 5 nm from coast | In a river |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| < 1 knots | Berth | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Berth |
| 1-3 knots | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Maneuvering |
| 3-5 knots | Maneuvering | Maneuvering | Maneuvering | Cruising | Maneuvering |
| > 5 knots | Maneuvering | Cruising | Cruising | Cruising | Cruising |

**Table 7.** Phase assignment decision matrix for liquid tankers

| Speed over ground | <= 1 nm from port | <= 1 nm from coast | 1-5 nm from port | 1-5 nm from coast | >= 5 nm from coast | In a river |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| < 1 knots | Berth | Anchor | Berth | Anchor | Anchor | Berth |
| 1-3 knots | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Anchor | Maneuvering |
| 3-5 knots | Maneuvering | Maneuvering | Maneuvering | Maneuvering | Cruising | Maneuvering |
| > 5 knots | Maneuvering | Cruising | Cruising | Cruising | Cruising | Cruising | 

Ships typically have three types of engines: MEs, mainly for propulsion purposes; AEs, normally for electricity generation; and BOs, for steam generation. The power demanded from these engines varies depending on the phase in which the ship is operating (Table 8). Main engines are turned off at berth and at anchor. Auxiliary engines are typically always on and boilers are normally turned on during low load maneuvering, berthing and anchorage. While some ports offer shore-side electrical power to allow ships to switch off their AEs at berth, this analysis assumes AEs are always on at berth.

**Table 8.** Assumed vessel engine state by phase

| Phase | Main engine state | Auxiliary engine state | Boiler state |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Berth | Off | On | On |
| Anchor | Off | On | On |
| Maneuvering | On | On | On |
| Cruising | On | On | Off |

>NOTE:
>A Boiler states are not assumed to be the same for all ship classes.

To determine the location of a point, we primarily use the coordinates of the points and intersect them with corresponding shapefiles. Table 9 is a list of shapefiles we use to determine whether a point lies within that shapefile. This is relevant for a few processes: phase assignment, operational fuel type assignment based on location-based policies.

|----|----|
|SOx Emission Control Areas| SOx emission factors, operational fuel type|

#### 3. Load factor estimation
Load factors are used to estimate instananeous main engine power output or instaneous fuel consumption rates, defined in Equation 3.

***Equation 3***

$$LF_{i,t}=\left(\frac{SOG_{t}*SAF_{i,t}}{V_{max}}\right)^3 * HFF_{i}*W_{t}*DAF_{i}$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
| i | = Ship |
| t | = time (operating hour, h) |
| $LF_{i,t}$ | = main engine load factor for ship i at time t|
| $SOG_{t}$ | = vessel speed over ground at time t|
| $SAF_{i,t}$ | = speed adjustment factor for ship i at time t|
| $V_{max}$ | = maximum ship speed|
| $HFF_{i}$ | = hull fouling factor for ship i|
| $W_{t}$ | = weather factor at time t|
| $DAF_{i}$ | = draught adjustment factor for ship i|

##### <ins>3.1 Speed adjustment factors</ins>
Although linearly interpolating missing AIS signals allows us to estimate emissions from missing data, it simplifies the path a ship takes. Because a linear interpolation takes the most
direct path between the first and last signals, it does not take into account maneuvering around coastal geography, islands, or bends in rivers. As a result, linearly interpolated SOGs tend to be lower than the SOGs actually reported, leading to underestimated emissions and activity. To rectify this discrepancy, we determine an average ratio between interpolated cruising and reported cruising speeds and between interpolated maneuvering speeds and reported maneuvering speeds for each individual ship. We call these ratios speed adjustment factors(SAF). When a ship is cruising and its SOG is interpolated, the interpolated SOG is multiplied by the ship’s cruising SAF. Similarly, when a ship is maneuvering and its SOG is interpolated, we apply its maneuvering SAF. When a ship is cruising or maneuvering and its SOG is not interpolated, we set the SAF equal to 1. 

Because missing SOGs for ferries, tugs, and fishing vessels are backfilled by a random sample of their reported SOGs, we did not apply speed adjustment factors to these ship classes. If after applying the SAF, the LF exceeds 1, the LF is assumed to be 0.98, because ships do not typically operate above 98% of MCR.

##### <ins>3.2 Hull fouling factors</ins>
As a ship travels, biological growth accumulates on its hull in a process known as hull fouling. Because hull fouling reduces the smoothness of the hull, it increases the friction between the ship and the surrounding water, causing an increase in the ship’s instantaneous power demand. On average, hull fouling increased the power demanded by an individual ship by about 7%, and
ranges from 2%–11% depending on the ship’s age and maintenance schedule. The hull roughness of a ship is determined by its age and the extent of biofouling on its hull. It is measured by method Rt50, which provides an Average Hull Roughness (AHR) in Qm. The AHR for a new ship is approximately 120 Qm, with an average increase of 30Qm per year (Doulgeris, Korakianitis, Pilidis, & Tsoudis, 2012), due to biofouling. However, irrespective of drydocking, the hull surface deteriorates with age, with an increase in its AHR. Based on Townsin (2000, 2003), and Willsher (2007), Table 2 shows the variation of AHR according to the vessel’s age.

**Table 10.** Average hull roughness based on the age of a ship

| Age of ship | AHR | 
|------------|-----|
|0-1 year|120 μm|
|2-5 years|150 μm|
|6-10 years|200 μm|
|11-15 years|300 μm|
|16-20 years|400 μm|
|>20 years|500 μm|

Based on Townsin (2000, 2003), the increase in total hull resistance can be calculated as shown in the formula below:

***Equation 4***

$$\frac{\Delta P_B}{P_B} - 0.02 = \frac{\Delta R}{R_T} = \frac{Delta C_F}{C_T} = \frac{0.044*\left(\frac{k_2}{L}^\left(1/3\right)-\frac{k_1}{L}^\left(1/3\right)\right)}{C_T}$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
|$\Delta P_B$|increase in brake power due to hull fouling (to maintain the same speed) |
|$P_B$|brake power without hull fouling |
|$\Delta R$|increase in ship resistance due to hull fouling |
|$R_T$|total resistance of the ship without hull fouling |
|$\Delta C_F$|increase in coefficient of frictional resistance due to hull fouling |
|$C_T$|coefficient of total resistance without hull fouling, which can be approximated as 0.018 x $L^\left(-1/3\right)$ |
|$k_1$|initial roughness of a new ship (120 µm)|
|$k_2$|final hull roughness depending on ship’s age, based on values from Table 2, and number of years after drydocking (assuming 5-yearly dry docking from the date of delivery, and a 30Qm annual increase in hull roughness due to biofouling). |
|L| length between the perpendiculars ($L_{BP}$)|

The above formula provides a ratio of the increase in brake power due to hull resistance to the original brake power. Rearranging the terms, HFF can be estimated as follows:

***Equation 5***

$$HFF = 1.02 + 0.044*\left(\frac{k_2}{L}^\left(1/3\right)-\frac{k_1}{L}^\left(1/3\right)\right) * \frac{1}{0.018* L^\left(-1/3\right)}$$

##### <ins>3.3 Weather factors</ins>
Local weather conditions also affect power demand. High winds and waves moving against the direction of travel increase the resistive force, thereby increasing the overall power demand,
while a favorable sea can assist in propulsion, significantly reducing the power demand. Following the lead of the Third IMO GHG Study 2014 (Smith et al., 2015), we assume an increase in power demand of 10% for coastal shipping, which we define as less than or equal to 5 nautical miles from the nearest shore, and an increase in power demand of 15% for international shipping, defined as greater than 5 nautical miles from the nearest shore.

##### <ins>3.4 Draught adjustment factors</ins>
The hydrodynamic resistance of a vessel depends on its wetted surface area, which is related to the vessel’s draught. Based on the admiralty coefficient and assuming a constant length (L),
breadth (B), block coefficient (Cb) and seawater density (ρop), the relationship between a vessel’s power requirement and draught (t) is:

$Power ∝ \Delta^\left(2/3\right) ∝ LBtC_{bρ_{sw}}^\left(2/3\right) ∝ t^\left(2/3\right)$

Therefore, by reducing the wetted surface area of a ship, a smaller draught reduces overall power requirements of the ship. During loaded conditions, most vessels operate below their design
summer load line draughts. Moreover, vessels like bulk carriers, tankers, and general cargo vessels have a well-defined ballast voyage with a significantly lesser draught than the loaded
voyage, further reducing the power requirement.

Based on the above principles, this study incorporates an annual average draught correction factor for individual ships, including different loaded and ballast correction factors for the
specific ship types. We assume any draught greater than 75% of the design draught is considered as loaded voyage. Draughts less than or equal to 75% of the design draught are considered
ballasted voyages. Vessels with fewer than 30 reported draughts are assumed to have draught ratios equal to the average draught ratio by either ship type and capacity bin, when available, or
ship class and capacity bin. 

Furthermore, the annual operation for ballasted ships is unequally divided between their ballast and loaded voyages. The proportion can vary due to several factors such as the cargo, market
conditions, geographical location, etc. Therefore, for each ship with dedicated loaded and ballast voyages, we also calculate the annual percentage of ballast and loaded voyages. Similar to
annual average draught ratio, vessels with insufficient draught data, which is to say less than 30 records, were backfilled with annual average percentage of ballast and loaded voyage by ship
type and capacity bin or ship class and capacity bin. 

Using the draught ratio and the percent of time spent in ballasted and loaded voyages, we can calculate a draught adjustment factor (DAF) for each unique ship:

***Equation 6***

$$DAF_{nbs}=DR_{nbs}^\left(2/3\right)$$

***Equation 7***

$$DAF_{bs}=DR_b^\left(2/3\right)*P_b + DR_l^\left(2/3\right)*P_l$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
|$DAF_{nbs}$|= draught adjustment factor for non-ballasted ships |
|$DR_{nbs}$|= draught ratio for non-ballasted ships |
|$DAF_{bs}$|= draught adjustment factor for ballasted ships |
|$DR_b$|= draught ratio for ballasted ships during ballast condition |
|$DR_l$|= draught ratio for ballasted ships during loaded condition |
|$P_b$|= percentage of ballast voyage annually for ballasted ships |
|$P_l$|= percentage of loaded voyage annually for ballasted ships. |

#### 4. Fuel consumption
Aligned with the [4th IMO GHG Study](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Environment/Documents/Fourth%20IMO%20GHG%20Study%202020%20-%20Full%20report%20and%20annexes.pdf), fuel consumption is a function of baseline specific fuel oil consumption rate ($SFOC_{baseline}$) and load factor ($LF_{t}$). $SFOC_{baseline}$ is dependent upon engine type, fuel type, and engine tier, in Table 11. Fuel consumption at a specific timestamp is estimated as follows:

***Equation 8***

$$FC_t=SFOC_t * P_t= SFOC_{baseline} * (0.455 * LF_t^2 - 0.71 * LF_t + 1.28) * P_t$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
| t | = time (operating hour, h) |
| $SFOC_t$ | = specific fuel oil consumption at time t, g/kWh|
| $P_t$|= power output of ME, AE or BO at time t, kW|
| $SFOC_{baseline}$ | = baseline specific fuel oil consumption, g/kWh|
| $LF_{t}$ | = main engine load factor at time t|

>NOTE:
>P_t for ME is dependent on LF_t, see Equation 1, P_t for AE and BO are by default, see Table 2,3.

#### 5. Emission factors 
Tank-to-wake (TTW) emission factors for nine pollutants were calculated: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, BC, SO<sub>X</sub>, PM, NO<sub>X</sub>, CO, and NMVOC. Among them, CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>X</sub> emissions are based on instananeous fuel consumption, while others are dependent upon instananeous power output.

##### <ins>5.1 CO<sub>2</sub></ins>
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are calculated based on instananeous fuel consumption and carbon factor of the associated fuel, using the equation below. Carbon factor assumptions are in Table 12.

***Equation 9***

$$CO_{2_t} = CarbonFactor * FC_t$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
| t | = time (operating hour, h) |
| $FC_t$ | = fuel consumption at time t, in grams|
| $CO_{2_t}$ | = CO<sub>2</sub> consumption at time t, in grams|

**Table 12.** Carbon factor assumptions, g CO<sub>2</sub>/g fuel

| Fuel type | Carbon factor |
| --- | --- |
|Residual|3.114|
|Distillate|3.206|
|Very low sulfur fuel oil|3.188|
|LNG|2.75|
|Methanol|1.375|

>NOTE:
>Very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), the fuel to comply with the global sulfur limit, is assumed to be 80% MGO blended with 20% HFO, thus carbon content is 80%*3.206+20%*3.114=3.188.

##### <ins>5.2 SO<sub>X</sub></ins>
SO<sub>X</sub> emissions are calculated based on instananeous fuel consumption and sulfur content of the associated fuel, using the equation below. Sulfur content assumptions are updated periodically according to sulfur monitoring report to the IMO. The current assumptions are in Table 13.

***Equation 10***

$$SO_{X_t} = FC_t * 2 * 0.97753 * SulfurFraction$$

where:

| indicies| description |
| --- | --- |
| t | = time (operating hour, h) |
| $FC_t$ | = specific fuel oil consumption at time t, in grams|
| $SO_{X_t}$ | = SO<sub>X</sub> consumption at time t, in grams|

##### <ins>5.8 Low load adjustment factors</ins>
Emission factors tend to increase at low loads. Low load adjustment factors from the Third IMO GHG Study 2014 were applied when estimated main engine load fell below 20% for all pollutants except BC, which is not estimated in the IMO study. In this case, BC emission factors are determined from power curves described in the previous section, which already account for changes in BC emission factors as a function of engine load. Low load adjustment factors are presented in Table 21.

#### 6. Other assumptions
##### <ins>6.1 Shore power</ins>
When a vessel’s phase is at-berth, the vessel is assumed to switch off its main engine, but is assumed to leave its AE, boiler, or both on to provide auxiliary power. However, some ports
provide onshore electrical power so that ships can switch off their AE and boiler to reduce fuel use and emissions close to coastal communities. That said, several ports offer shoreside power
only to smaller vessels such as ferries, and shoreside power may not be used even when it is available. Future work could explore the characteristics of existing shore power facilities,
including the number of electrified berths, power supply, electricity source, potential air emissions, and so forth to estimate the emission impacts of using shore power. Additional work
could also explore the emission impacts of expanding the use of shore power. The current version of SAVE doesn't consider shore power emissions.

##### <ins>6.2 Scrubbers</ins>
Ships installed with scrubbers, or Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) to comply with IMO's Global Sulfur Limit in 2020 are treated as a special case, with the following assumptions:
* Before 2020, ships installed with scrubbers only use them to comply with ECA regulations; ships still operate on Residual fuel, but the effective SOx emissions are optimized to container 0.1% sulfur. PM emission factors are assumed to be 0.3g/kWh.
* After 2020, ships installed with scrubbers use them to comply with both Global Sulfur Limit and ECA. While in ECA, SOx emissions are optimized to container 0.1% sulfur; while outside of ECA, SOx emissions are optimized to container 0.5% sulfur. PM emission factors are assumed to be 0.3g/kWh.
* More and more ports/regions have enacted a ban of closed-loop EGCS discharge, which in effect bans the use of scrubbers due to environmental and ecological concerns of scrubber discharge. See ICCT's scrubber update for details. This study doesn’t take scrubber ban into account.

## Methodology: Type3&4
The estimated emissions of Type3 vessels were derived as follows:
1. Using the generic vessel type estimate made available by GFW, the Type 1, 2, and 3 vessels were classified into one of six vessel groups: Fishing, Passenger, Cargo, Reefer, Tanker and Other. These correspond with the previously defined IMO vessel types:
   * Fishing: Miscellaneous – fishing
   * Passenger: Cruise, Ferry – ro-pax, Ferry - pax only.
   * Cargo: Bulk carrier, Container, General cargo, Ro-Ro, Vehicle carrier.
   * Reefer: Refrigerated bulk.
   * Tanker: Oil tanker, Chemical tanker, Liquified gas tanker, Other liquid tankers.
   * Other: Service-other, Service-tug, Offshore, Yacht, Miscellaneous – other.
2. The interquartile range of gross tonnage for Type 3 vessels by ship group was calculated. This range was then used to select a subset of Type 1 and Type 2 vessels by ship group for use as emission proxies.
3. For each ship group of filtered Type 1 and Type 2 vessels, the following variables were calculated:
   * average within-group emission rates (g/hour) for each pollutant;
   * average within-group fuel consumption rates (g/hour) for each fuel type;
   * average within-in group international/domestic activity split (% of total hours).
4. These variables were then applied to the set of Type 3 vessels, according to ship group.
5. The hours of activity for the Type 3 vessels were summarized from AIS signals without interpolation.
6. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the emission rates and adjusted activity hours; fuel consumption was calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption rates and adjusted activity    
   hours.

The estimation process for Type 4 vessels was as follows:
1. Using observed activity and emissions data from Type 1 and Type 2 vessels with a gross tonnage of between 100 and 300 tonnes, an average number of operational hours and an average hourly emissions rate for each pollutant was calculated for each vessel type and size.
2. These values were used as proxies for the annual operational hours and emissions rate for the Type 4 fleet and multiplied together to give a representative total annual emissions figure for each vessel type and size.
3. These emissions estimates were allocated to international or domestic sets by assuming that the proportion of international and domestic hours were identical to the average Type 1 and Type 2 vessel per type, and with a gross tonnage of between 100 and 300 tonnes.
